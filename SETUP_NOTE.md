# 🚀 REBOUND CRM - COMPLETE SETUP

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: I've hit response limits!

I've created the folder structure but need to give you the complete App.jsx separately.

## 📦 What's Ready:
✅ Package.json
✅ All config files (vite, tailwind, postcss)
✅ SkipTraceModal.jsx
✅ ContactsSection.jsx  
✅ supabase.js
✅ main.jsx
✅ index.css

## ❌ What's Missing:
The complete App.jsx with skip tracing integrated (it's 600+ lines)

---

## 🎯 EASIEST SOLUTION:

### Option 1: I'll send you a ZIP file
Let me create a complete ZIP with everything and share it

### Option 2: Start fresh in a new chat
Copy this message:
"I need the complete Rebound CRM with skip tracing built in. I have the Supabase database set up already. Can you create the full project folder with all files?"

Then I can build it fresh without hitting limits!

---

## 💡 OR - Quick Fix:

If you want to continue here:
1. I'll give you just the App.jsx code in the next message
2. You copy it into `C:\rebound-crm-complete\src\App.jsx`
3. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`

**Which do you prefer?**
